## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a DevOps learner focused on building hands-on experience with modern infrastructure tools and workflows, including Kubernetes, Docker, and GitOps practices. This repository is a reflection of my learning journey, where I share personal projects, labs, and experiments that explore cloud-native development and infrastructure automation.

My main goal is to understand how to deploy, scale, and manage applications efficiently using containerization and orchestration. Docker has been instrumental in helping me package and run applications consistently across environments, while Kubernetes has opened the door to learning about dynamic scaling, self-healing systems, and service discovery. Iâ€™m also diving into GitOps, aiming to manage infrastructure through version-controlled, declarative configurations.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find a collection of practical projects and configurationsâ€”ranging from basic Kubernetes cluster setups and Helm charts to CI/CD pipelines and GitOps workflows using tools like Argo CD or Flux. I document each project thoroughly, breaking down the "why" and "how" behind each step, to reinforce my understanding and to help others following a similar path.

I value clear, reusable code and well-structured project layouts, especially when dealing with complex systems. My aim is to make each project not only functional, but also easy to explore, replicate, and build upon.

Whether youâ€™re a fellow DevOps learner, a cloud engineer, or just curious about the tooling behind scalable infrastructure, feel free to explore the code, leave feedback, or contribute. Iâ€™m always open to new insights, collaboration, and learning from the broader tech community.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and happy shipping!
